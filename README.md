## Disclaimer ❎

This repository documents a chronological timeline of events experienced during the interview process with [StrongDM](https://www.linkedin.com/company/strongdm/), Inc. (a cybersecurity company being acquired by Delinea).

## Executive Summary 📋

This case involves a Solutions Architect candidate who disclosed neurodivergence on January 9, 2026, and requested interview accommodations. Despite explicit confirmation from their recruiter [Lindsey Shanks](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindseyshanks) that the VP interview would be a "culture fit conversation," the accommodation was violated on February 4, 2026, when VP [Alex Pai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alpai/) conducted an unexpected technical interrogation instead. The candidate was rejected on February 5, 2026, despite unanimous support from the technical team and hiring manager—with only the VP dissenting.

After the candidate went [public with their experience](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427394680491020288/), StrongDM executives engaged in consciousness of guilt behaviors including blocking the candidate on LinkedIn. The company ignored a February 18, 2026 settlement deadline, choosing litigation over private resolution.

The following timeline is supported by primary source evidence including audio recordings, email correspondence, and documented behavioral patterns.

📛 **Discriminatory Rejection**: Unanimous technical approval overridden by VP who violated accommodation, with no substantive technical justification provided.

👻 **Consciousness of Guilt**: Multiple executives engaged in blocking behaviors on professional networking platforms after public documentation.

🚨 **Fraudulent Marketing**: Company published content claiming to champion neurodivergent professionals while actively discriminating against neurodivergent candidate.

🔇 **Settlement Refusal**: Company chose silence over private resolution

## Legal Actions

- **EEOC Complaint**: Filed February 12, 2026 (Case pending)
- **Washington State Human Rights Commission**: Filed February 12, 2026 (Case pending)

## Conclusion 

This repository illustrates a failure of accommodation procedures, discriminatory hiring practices, and corporate accountability. The events document how disability-based discrimination manifests in modern tech hiring, even at companies that publicly claim inclusion values.
<br>

This case is part of a documented pattern of discrimination against neurodivergent Black women in technology.

*Published as a cautionary case study for the industry. These patterns continue because documentation is rare and accountability is rarer. Evidence protects those they are designed to shield.*
